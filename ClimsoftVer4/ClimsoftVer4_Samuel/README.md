CLIMSOFT is a climate data management system (CDMS) primarily aimed at meeting
the climate data management needs of national meteorological and hydrological
services (NHMS) in developing and least developed countries. However, with
recent developements, the CDMS would be able to meet the needs of Regional
Climate Centres (RCCs) and also NMHSs in developed countries. CLIMSOFT was 
originated in Africa following a WMO workshop held at ACMAD in 1999. The CDMS 
was positively evaluated by WMO in 2002 and the development of the CDMS is being 
sponsored by the UK Met Office.The development and implementation of CLIMSOFT
has evolved into an open-source project led by a Steering Committee currently 
made up of top management of stakeholder NHMS in Africa (namely Guinea, Kenya 
and Zimbabwe), ACMAD, ICPAC, and representatives of WMO and the UK Met Office. 
Since 2015, the development team of CLIMSOFT is being expanded to include an 
increasing number of collaborators drawn mainly from NMHS in Africa. The latest 
version of CLIMSOFT, version 4, is targeted for release in mid 2016.
